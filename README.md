## TL;DR

```ocaml
let get-image ratio path =
  path |> String.append `images/`
       |> Image.of-jpeg
       |> Inline.of-image (13.5cm |> Length.scale ratio)
in

ctx |> Inline.read {
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
  \eval(Inline.mandatory-break);
  \eval-const(`fox.jpg` |> get-image 0.45);
}
```

## What is satysfi-base

This repository contains a collection of utility functions and modules for SATySFi.
Because the library bundled with the default installation configuration of SATySFi is currently not rich enough, this project aims to provide a complementary library sufficient for most situations in typesetting.

Our repository contains:

- basic types and utilities (e.g. String, Char, etc)
- data structures (e.g. Array, Map, etc)
- program controls (e.g. Ref, Lazy, etc)
- text processing (e.g. RegExp, Lexer, Parser, etc)
- extra typesetting functions (e.g. Inline, Pager, etc)

We also provide some specific packages for typesetting:

- `derive`: display proof trees
- `code2`: display program sources with syntax highlight

## Installation

Easy installation using satyrographos:

```console
$ opam install satysfi-base
```
